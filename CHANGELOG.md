# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Projects are discovered, not declared.** Everything in `defaults.root` is
  sensed, whether or not the registry names it. A directory you add tomorrow is
  in tomorrow's brief with no edit to `registry.jsonc`.

  The registry stops being the list of what exists and becomes the list of what
  you have said something *about* — a tier, a goal, a deadline, a privacy rule.
  A discovered project is ranked like any other but carries neutral placeholders
  instead of judgements, and the snapshot marks it `declared: false`. No
  `goal_one_line` is invented: that is the one field where a placeholder would
  be a fabrication rather than an absence.

  This replaces a failure with no symptom. Under declare-first, a project you
  started and never registered was not reported as missing — it was absent, and
  the brief read exactly like a brief for a week in which nothing else happened.

  Never adopted: anything already in `projects` / `watch` / `infra` / `archived`
  (matched on the first path segment, so `atlas/apps/site` still claims
  `novel`); anything in `ignored`; dotfile directories and build/OS folders; the
  workspace itself; and nextbrief's own source checkout.

### Fixed

- **`ignored` now does something during a run.** It was read only by `init`, so
  a list written specifically to keep directories out of the brief had no effect
  on any brief. It is the opt-out for discovery, and the sensing stage honours
  it.

## [0.1.0rc6] - 2026-07-28

Second prerelease, still on TestPyPI. The engine's read-only promise stops being
a property of the code that remembered it and becomes a property of the package.

### Added

- **Containment and delete gates**, in a new `nextbrief.fs` module that is now
  the only place in the package that mutates a filesystem. Every write, append,
  frontmatter rewrite, rename and delete is checked against the resolved
  workspace before it happens. Previously this held only for the two helpers in
  the renderer; the sensing stage, the CLI and the frontmatter writer wrote
  unchecked, so the guarantee covered roughly the code that remembered it.
- **Human-only paths.** Backlog entries, `registry.jsonc` and `config.jsonc`
  cannot be deleted or renamed by the engine. The write-permission gate already
  refused to let anything automated set a terminal status; deleting an entry
  reaches the same end state and destroys the record that it ever existed, so it
  is refused in the same spirit. Directories are refused outright — there is no
  recursive delete and nothing has needed one.
- **Declared exits.** The three places that legitimately write outside a
  workspace — the `init` pointer file, `permissions --merge-into`, and its
  backup — now name themselves against a list in `fs.ESCAPES`. An undeclared
  reason raises. A test asserts the list and the call sites have not drifted
  apart, and that neither `sense` nor `render` can reach the door at all.
- `nextbrief done` now refuses to `git add` a path outside the workspace, so a
  commit cannot stage someone else's work under a backlog message.

### Changed

- `append_jsonl` and `append_text` now **raise** on a target outside the
  workspace instead of returning `False`. Log writes remain fail-open for
  `OSError` — a full disk still costs a log line rather than the run — but an
  out-of-workspace target is a caller bug, and a bug that returns `False` ships.
  No caller in the package was affected; all of them append inside `log/`.

## [0.1.0rc5] - 2026-07-27

First public prerelease. On [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/nextbrief/),
not PyPI, and the GitHub release is marked as a prerelease — the version routes
itself there, because publishing an rc to the real index cannot be undone.

The engine had been running nightly against a private multi-project workspace for
some months before being extracted into a package; this is that code, with the
workspace removed and the interfaces made configurable. `0.1.0` will follow once
the rc has been used by someone who did not write it.

### Added

- **Three-stage pipeline.** `sense` walks the projects you own and writes a
  deterministic `state/snapshot.json`; a model reads a compact digest of it and
  writes `state/brief.json`; `render` turns that into `BRIEF.md` and
  `BRIEF.html`. Only the middle stage involves a model.
- **Evidence gate.** Every claim the model makes must cite a source that
  resolves against the snapshot. Claims that do not resolve are never rendered —
  they go to `log/rejected.jsonl` with a reason code. The check lives in the
  renderer rather than the prompt, so it cannot be drifted from.
- **Non-goals gate.** Things a project has declared it will not do are lifted
  verbatim into the snapshot; proposals that collide with one are flagged rather
  than removed.
- **Write-permission gate.** Backlog items are diffed field-by-field against
  their committed versions and out-of-bounds edits are reverted. No agent can
  set a terminal status; it may only propose one for a human to confirm.
- **Caps gate.** Per-section limits with overflow written to
  `log/deferred.jsonl`, so the brief cannot grow without bound and nothing is
  lost when it hits the limit.
- **Two renderings, one dataset.** `BRIEF.md` for terminals and diffs,
  `BRIEF.html` for reading — expandable items, copy-to-clipboard commands,
  light/dark, fully offline. The HTML re-decides nothing, so the two cannot
  disagree.
- **`launch` context builder.** Proposes candidate working directories for a
  backlog item, ordered by how likely each is to be the right one, and opens a
  session pre-loaded with context. No input is treated as cancel.
- **Pluggable providers and sinks.** The model backend and the notification
  channel are both swappable modules with narrow contracts.
- **English and Simplified Chinese locales**, with all user-facing strings in
  catalogs rather than in code.
- **JSONC configuration.** `registry.jsonc` declares what your projects are and
  which documents to read; `config.jsonc` holds thresholds and weights. Comments
  and trailing commas are permitted, because configuration you cannot annotate
  is configuration nobody maintains.
- **Idempotence self-check** that exits `3` when a re-run would change the
  snapshot, so the nightly job is safe to trigger at any time.
- **Cost controls.** A compact digest is sent to the model instead of the full
  snapshot; on the reference workspace this cut per-run cost from $4.37 to
  $0.74, mostly by reducing agent turns rather than bytes. See
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Design constraints

Not features, but the reasons the code looks the way it does:

- **Zero runtime dependencies**, standard library only, Python 3.9 and up. The
  nightly run is started by a GUI scheduler with a minimal `PATH` and must work
  under the system interpreter.
- **Read-only outside the workspace.** The engine reads your projects and writes
  only its own directory, so it can never damage anything it observes.
- **Fail-open throughout.** A parser that cannot understand a file records the
  path and returns nothing; external tools are optional. One bad document does
  not cost you the brief.
